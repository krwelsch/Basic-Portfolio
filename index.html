          <p class="bio">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Everyone, welcome to my page! I am currently a Senior Accountant at a large multi-national corporation in Broomfield, Colorado. I have a BA in Accounting from Dakota Wesleyan University and a Master of Business Administration from Oregon State University.  I have worked in a variety of environments, from small startups with limited resources to large corporations going through mergers to sizeable established companies. I have worked at the corporate headquarters, small regional offices and even in the maintenance offices of a papermill.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite roles have elements in both accounting and analytics. I perform the monthly close process regularly and have reconciled countless balance sheets. I have experience forecasting and performing variance analysis, budgeting, and calculating ROI and other analytics related to capital expenditure requests.  In many of my roles, I have found myself constricted by the limited data mining/BI resources available to people in my position.  I have dabbled with data mining and VBA in the past but only began to scratch the surface of what tools are out there. I have been wanting to dive deeper for years and am excited for the opportunity to learn a new, fun art that will compliment my accounting skills.<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up 4 hours to the north of Denver, in small town Nebraska.  My family moved to Colorado when I was just out of college, so although I've lived in some amazing places, I have always thought of Colorado as my second home.  In my free time, I hike, camp, kayak, go to Rockies games, Red Rocks, snowboard, travel, play volleyball and pretty much just stay active and outdoors.<br><br>
